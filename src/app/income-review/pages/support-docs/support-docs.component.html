    <strong>If you want</strong> HIBC to consider your income for last year as
    well as your income for this year, you can upload your CRA Notice of
    Assessment / Reassessment or <u>proof of income statement</u>;
    <strong>AND</strong> if applicable, T4A slip for RDSP income.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If you haven't yet filed last year's income tax, you may apply using tax
    slips (e.g., T4, T4E) for all income sources. This option is not available
    after June 1.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If your application using this year's income is rejected for any reason,
