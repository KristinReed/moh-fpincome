    I certify that the information given in this application form and any
    documentation attached to it is true, correct, and complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    I declare that my family's current net income is at least 10% lower than the
    net income used to calculate the Fair PharmaCare coverage I now have.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consent to allow the Canada Revenue Agency to release information from my
    income tax returns and, if applicable, other required taxpayer information,
    to the B.C. Ministry of Health and Health Insurance BC.
  </p>
  <p>
    The information provided will be used solely to determine, verify and
    administer my and/or my family's Fair PharmaCare Plan coverage under the
    British Columbia Pharmaceutical Services Act.
  </p>
  <p>
    I further agree that if the Canada Revenue Agency later confirms that my net
    income was higher than declared in this application, I will repay the
    Ministry of Health any assistance I received in excess of the assistance for
    which I was eligible.
